# pyaudio-source-control
A program that uses Pyaudio to process voice commands on a Raspberry Pi.

This was originally designed for my boss to control his Crestron processor via voice instruction and essentially provide a hands-free experience from Crestron Toolbox. It creates a socket that sends string commands to SIMPL Windows which parses and executes them there.
